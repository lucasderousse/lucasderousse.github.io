        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Lucas (or Luke) DeRousse grew up in Wentzville, Missouri. In a town often referred to as a "truck stop town", Lucas found little love for sports growing up. Instead, Lucas found his happiness with computers.<br><br>While in 8th grade, Lucas built his first desktop computer. This was an old office computer bought for $200 by his parents and gifted to him for christmas that had been fitted with old parts given to him by his older brother.<br><br>In High School, Lucas was exposed to his first formal courses in IT. This ranged from classes where he fixed school chromebooks with hardware swaps and Chrome OS flashes, to programming courses where he was first exposed to Python and HTML.<br><br>Rather than going to college after High School, Lucas opted to join the top 1% of the nation and joined the United States Air Force as a Cyber Defense Airmen. During his 5 year term of service, Lucas was awarded the <em>Armed Forces Service Medal</em>, as well as the <em>Humanitarian Service Medal</em> for his efforts during his deployment to Kuwait in 2022.</p>
