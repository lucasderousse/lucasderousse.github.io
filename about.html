        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Lucas (or Luke) DeRousse grew up in Wentzville, Missouri. In a town often referred to as a "truck stop town", Lucas found little love for sports growing up. Instead, Lucas found his happiness with computers.</p><p>While in 8th grade, Lucas built his first desktop computer. This was an old office computer bought for $200 by his parents and gifted to him for christmas that had been fitted with old parts given to him by his older brother.</p><p>In High School, Lucas was exposed to his first formal courses in IT. This ranged from classes where he fixed school chromebooks with hardware swaps and Chrome OS flashes, to programming courses where he was first exposed to <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>HTML.</mark></p>

      <h3>Military Service</h3>
      <p>Rather than going to college after High School, Lucas opted to join the top 1% of the nation and joined the United States Air Force as a Cyber Defense Airmen. He had joined the inactive reserves between his junior and senior year of High School at the age of 17.</p>
      <p>During his 5 year term of service, Lucas was awarded the <em>Armed Forces Service Medal</em>, as well as the <em>Humanitarian Service Medal</em> for his efforts during his deployment to Kuwait in 2022. During his service is also when Lucas found his love for fitness as well, which is a space he is still actively in today (no pun intended).</p><p>In order, Lucas spent 1.5 years at Holloman, AFB in Alamogordo, New Mexico serving as a Ground Control Station (GCS) Communications specialist for the MQ-9 "Reaper" drones. This was by far the fastest-paced workcenter he has worked in to this day, and what he even attributes to a bulk of his work ethic to this day. Holloman AFB at this time was conducting a training mission consisting of 12 simultaneuous GCS', meaning 12 unmanned aircraft pilots were relying on his maintenance skills to conduct their operations.</p>
