        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Lucas (or Luke) DeRousse grew up in Wentzville, Missouri. In a town often referred to as a "truck stop town", Lucas found little love for sports growing up. Instead, Lucas found his happiness with computers.</p><br>
        <p>While in 8th grade, Lucas built his first desktop computer. This was an old office computer bought for $200 by his parents and gifted to him for christmas that had been fitted with old parts given to him by his older brother.</p><p>In High School, Lucas was exposed to his first formal courses in IT. This ranged from classes where he fixed school chromebooks with hardware swaps and Chrome OS flashes, to programming courses where he was first exposed to <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>HTML</mark>.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Military Service</h3>
        <p>Rather than going to college after High School, Lucas opted to join the top 1% of the nation and joined the United States Air Force as a Cyber Defense Airman. He had joined the inactive reserves between his junior and senior year of High School at the age of 17.</p><br>
        <p>During his 5 year term of service, Airman DeRousse was awarded the <em>Armed Forces Service Medal</em>, as well as the <em>Humanitarian Service Medal</em> for his efforts during his deployment to Kuwait in 2022. During his service is also when Lucas found his love for fitness as well, which is a space he is still actively in today (no pun intended).</p>
        <p>In order, Lucas spent 1.5 years at Holloman, AFB in Alamogordo, New Mexico serving as a Ground Control Station (GCS) Communications specialist for the MQ-9 "Reaper" drones. This was by far the fastest-paced workcenter he has worked in to this day, and what he even attributes to a bulk of his work ethic to this day. Holloman AFB at this time was conducting a training mission consisting of 12 simultaneuous GCS', meaning 12 unmanned aircraft pilots were relying on his maintenance skills to conduct their operations.</p>
        <p>Lucas was later stationed at RAF Croughton in the United Kingdom, which about 20 minutes outside of Oxford where he spent most of his weekends. It was here that Lucas learned a bulk of his knowledge today. This mainly came from his opportunity to be the primary POC for his office's Land Mobile Radio program. Most of these radios are operated over a trunked IP network that he is still trying to wrap his head around how it all works <u>to this day</u>. A bulk of his job was supporting every squadron on base with radio communications, primarily emergency responders such as Security Forces, Fire Protection and Emergency Operation Centers during base exercises. It was also here that he earned his <em>CompTIA Security+</em> certification through means of a course he was sent to.</p>
        <p>During his 3 year contract in England, Lucas was tasked with a deployment to Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait. It was here that Lucas supported the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the airlift of Afghani citizens to be refugees in the United States. For these efforts, he was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, as well as the Armed Forces Service Medal. Shortly after returning from this deployment is when he finished his Associates degree from the Community College of the Air Force, as an Associate of Science (A.S.) in Electronic Systems.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Post-Service Life</h3>
        <p>Lucas separated from the U.S. Air Force on October 20, 2023. He has since found Employment at St. Charles County's Emergency Operation Center located in O'Fallon, MO. He is now supporting all the public service members for a County of 400,000 people. Since leaving the military however, the military hasn't left Lucas. He has found his passion in education, with a strong desire to become the best Software Engineer he can be. He has decided to achieve this goal through enrolling at Western Governor's University for his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Software Engineering. This University was perfect, as it allowed him to work full time, as well as learn full time. Although self-paced, he is planning on graduating in January of 2026.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Final Notes</h3>
        Today, Lucas spends most days learning new concepts introduced through course materials, as well as his place of employment. Most afternoons are spent glued to a computer screen, studying and coding (guess when he wrote this...).</p><p>At the resilient age of 23, Lucas DeRousse has kept his head high and his future bright through fitness, learning and not allowing complacency.<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.
